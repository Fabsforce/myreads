# MyReads Project

MyReads is a react application built as the final assessment for the React Fundamentals course  of the  Udacity React Nanodegree.
The application consists of list of books the user can place on 3 different shelves : Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read.
In using the search page, the user can easily add new books to his/her shelves. It is also possible to remove books from the personnal list by chosing 'none' as shelf. The app only permits to search and add books from restricted list of terms that can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md file.

## Installation

Install the project dependencies in running in your console :

`% npm install`

## Start the development server with

`% npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
